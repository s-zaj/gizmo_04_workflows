## Some examples of "Contributing" guidelines

### LLVM

Excerpt from the [LLVM Contributing guide](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html#how-to-submit-a-patch)

A patch should:

* not contain any unrelated changes
* be an isolated change. Independent changes should be submitted as separate patches as this makes reviewing easier.
* have a single commit (unless stacked on another Differential), up-to-date with the upstream origin/main branch, and donâ€™t have merges.
